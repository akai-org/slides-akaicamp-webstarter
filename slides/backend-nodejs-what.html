<ul class="pros-cons">
  <li class="plus">it emerged since ~2-3 years and is becoming quickly popular</li>
  <li class="plus">remember Atwood's Law? Now we can create servers in JavaScript</li>
  <li class="plus">examples? PayPal</li>
  <li class="plus">event-driven - well-adjusted to asynchronous usage (which is really usable in web)</li>
  <li class="minus">still emerging (not quite mature yet)</li>
  <li class="minus">some existing experience with webdevelopment and JavaScript will be essential - it's not easy to write async code</li>
</ul>
